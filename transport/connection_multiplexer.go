// ADDED: Package-level documentation for connection multiplexing functionality.
// This file implements connection multiplexing for the Tox transport layer,
// allowing multiple logical connections to share a single physical transport.
//
// The ConnectionMultiplexer provides:
//   - Virtual connection management over UDP/TCP transports
//   - Packet routing to appropriate connection handlers
//   - Connection lifecycle management (create, maintain, cleanup)
//   - Performance statistics and monitoring
//   - Automatic cleanup of stale connections
//
// Example usage:
//
//	transport, _ := net.ListenPacket("udp", ":0")
//	multiplexer := NewConnectionMultiplexer(transport)
//	multiplexer.Start()
//	defer multiplexer.Stop()
//
//	// Create a logical connection
//	conn, _ := multiplexer.CreateConnection(remoteAddr)
//
//	// Send packets over the connection
//	packet := &Packet{PacketType: PacketTypePing, Data: []byte("ping")}
//	multiplexer.SendPacket(conn.ID, packet)

// It provides virtual connection abstraction, allowing multiple peers to communicate
// simultaneously over UDP or TCP while maintaining separate connection states,
// statistics, and packet routing. This enables efficient resource utilization
// and simplifies connection management in the Tox protocol implementation.
//
// The multiplexer handles:
//   - Creating and managing logical connections
//   - Routing incoming packets to appropriate handlers
//   - Maintaining per-connection statistics and health metrics
//   - Automatic cleanup of inactive or stale connections
//   - Thread-safe concurrent access to connection state
