You maintain a Go implementation derived from the Tox messaging protocol, but it has diverged enough to be a distinct product. Create a concise new project name and a short renaming plan that meet these goals:

Requirements
- Name must convey: enhanced security, modernized features, and forward-looking improvements.
- Keep a clear, deliberate link to the Tox ecosystem so users understand compatibility/heritage.
- Provide variants suitable for: full project name, short codename, Go module/package name, and repository slug.

Deliverables (brief)
1. Five candidate names (each <= 5 words) with 1–2-line rationales.
2. One recommended canonical choice and a 1-line justification.
3. Suggested Go module import path and GitHub repo slug for the canonical name (lowercase, hyphenated).
4. A 1-paragraph README header that explains the rename, compatibility with the Tox network, and what changed (security/features).
5. Two short migration notes for existing users and developers (package renames, compatibility guarantees). Acknowledge both the Tox and Noise prior art.

Tone & constraints
- Keep each item concise and actionable.
- Avoid trademark conflicts where obvious; prefer neutral, technical phrasing.
- Total output under 400 words.

Example lead: "NewName — a secure, modernized, Go-native fork compatible with the Tox network." Use that structure if helpful.
