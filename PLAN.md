# Architectural Redesign Plan for Multi-Network Support

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the architectural changes required to eliminate RED FLAG areas in `dht/handler.go` and `transport/nat.go` that currently prevent support for alternative network types (.onion, .b32.i2p, .nym, .loki). The current implementation assumes IP-based addressing and performs address parsing that breaks abstraction.

## Current Problems

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **Wire Protocol Assumptions** (`dht/handler.go`)
   - Fixed 16-byte IP + 2-byte port binary format
   - IPv4/IPv6 format detection and parsing
   - Address serialization tied to IP semantics

2. **NAT Detection Logic** (`transport/nat.go`)
   - IP address parsing for private range detection
   - Interface enumeration with IP-specific logic
   - Public address detection through IP parsing

3. **Protocol Rigidity**
   - No extensibility for new address types
   - Hardcoded assumptions about address structure
   - No negotiation mechanism for supported networks

## Redesign Architecture

### Phase 1: Core Protocol Extensions

#### 1.1 Address Type System

**New Address Type Enumeration:**
```go
type AddressType uint8

const (
    AddressTypeIPv4     AddressType = 0x01
    AddressTypeIPv6     AddressType = 0x02
    AddressTypeOnion    AddressType = 0x03  // Tor .onion
    AddressTypeI2P      AddressType = 0x04  // I2P .b32.i2p
    AddressTypeNym      AddressType = 0x05  // Nym .nym
    AddressTypeLoki     AddressType = 0x06  // Lokinet .loki
    AddressTypeUnknown  AddressType = 0xFF
)
```

**Network Address Abstraction:**
```go
type NetworkAddress struct {
    Type     AddressType
    Data     []byte          // Variable-length address data
    Port     uint16          // Optional port (0 if not applicable)
    Network  string          // Network identifier ("tcp", "udp", "tor", etc.)
}

func (na *NetworkAddress) ToNetAddr() net.Addr
func (na *NetworkAddress) String() string
func (na *NetworkAddress) IsPrivate() bool
func (na *NetworkAddress) IsRoutable() bool
```

#### 1.2 Wire Protocol Versioning

**Protocol Version Constants:**
```go
type ProtocolVersion uint8

const (
    ProtocolLegacy   ProtocolVersion = 0x01  // Current IP-only protocol
    ProtocolNoiseIK  ProtocolVersion = 0x02  // Extended with Noise-IK
)
```

**Packet Format Negotiation:**
- Legacy format: 6 bytes (4-byte IPv4 + 2-byte port) or 18 bytes (16-byte IPv6 + 2-byte port)
- Extended format: Variable length (1-byte type + N-byte address + 2-byte port)
- Backward compatibility layer for existing nodes

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Create `PacketParser` interface for protocol-specific parsing
- Implement `LegacyIPParser` for backward compatibility
- Implement `ExtendedParser` for new address types
- Add version negotiation for peer capabilities

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**
- `transport/parser.go` - PacketParser interface system with NodeEntry struct
- `transport/parser_test.go` - Comprehensive test coverage with benchmarks
- LegacyIPParser supports IPv4/IPv6 with 50-byte fixed format
- ExtendedParser supports all address types with variable-length format
- ParserSelector provides protocol version-based parser selection
- Round-trip compatibility validated between both parsers
- Performance: ~130ns/op for both parsers (excellent performance)

### Phase 2: DHT Handler Redesign

#### 2.1 Address Parsing Abstraction

**Current Problem Area:**
```go
// RED FLAG: dht/handler.go parseAddressFromPacket()
func (bm *BootstrapManager) parseAddressFromPacket(data []byte, nodeOffset int) net.Addr
```

**Proposed Solution:**
```go
// New wire protocol parser
type PacketParser interface {
    ParseNodeEntry(data []byte, offset int) (NodeEntry, int, error)
    SerializeNodeEntry(entry NodeEntry) ([]byte, error)
}

type NodeEntry struct {
    PublicKey [32]byte
    Address   NetworkAddress
    LastSeen  time.Time
}

// Protocol-specific parsers
type LegacyIPParser struct{}  // For backward compatibility
type ExtendedParser struct{}  // For new address types

func (bm *BootstrapManager) parseNodeEntry(data []byte, offset int) (NodeEntry, int, error) {
    parser := bm.selectParser(data, offset)
    return parser.ParseNodeEntry(data, offset)
}
```

#### 2.2 Address Serialization

**Current Problem Area:**
```go
// RED FLAG: dht/handler.go formatIPAddress()
func (bm *BootstrapManager) formatIPAddress(addr net.Addr) []byte
```

**Proposed Solution:**
```go
// Network-agnostic serialization
func (bm *BootstrapManager) serializeNodeEntry(entry NodeEntry) []byte {
    return bm.parser.SerializeNodeEntry(entry)
}

// Address conversion utilities
func ConvertNetAddrToNetworkAddress(addr net.Addr) (NetworkAddress, error) {
    // Detect address type and convert appropriately
    switch addr.Network() {
    case "tcp", "udp":
        return parseIPAddress(addr)
    case "tor":
        return parseTorAddress(addr)
    case "i2p":
        return parseI2PAddress(addr)
    default:
        return NetworkAddress{Type: AddressTypeUnknown}, nil
    }
}
```

### Phase 3: NAT System Redesign

**Proposed Solution:**
```go
type NetworkCapabilities struct {
    SupportsNAT     bool
    SupportsUPnP    bool
    IsPrivateSpace  bool
    RoutingMethod   RoutingMethod
}

type RoutingMethod int
const (
    RoutingDirect     RoutingMethod = iota  // Direct routing
    RoutingNAT                              // Behind NAT
    RoutingProxy                            // Through proxy (Tor, I2P)
    RoutingMixed                            // Multiple methods
)

// Network-specific capability detection
type NetworkDetector interface {
    DetectCapabilities(addr net.Addr) NetworkCapabilities
    SupportedNetworks() []string
}

type IPNetworkDetector struct{}      // IPv4/IPv6 detection
type TorNetworkDetector struct{}     // Tor .onion detection  
type I2PNetworkDetector struct{}     // I2P .b32.i2p detection
```

#### 3.2 Multi-Network Public Address Detection

**Current Problem Area:**
```go
// RED FLAG: transport/nat.go detectPublicAddress()
```

**Proposed Solution:**
```go
type PublicAddressResolver interface {
    ResolvePublicAddress(localAddr net.Addr) (net.Addr, error)
    SupportsNetwork(network string) bool
}

type MultiNetworkResolver struct {
    resolvers map[string]PublicAddressResolver
}

// Network-specific resolvers
type IPResolver struct{}       // STUN/UPnP for IP networks
type TorResolver struct{}      // Tor descriptor for .onion
type I2PResolver struct{}      // I2P netdb for .b32.i2p

func (mnr *MultiNetworkResolver) ResolvePublicAddress(addr net.Addr) (net.Addr, error) {
    resolver := mnr.selectResolver(addr.Network())
    return resolver.ResolvePublicAddress(addr)
}
```

### Phase 4: Transport Layer Integration

#### 4.1 Multi-Protocol Transport

**Current Limitation:**

- No support for Tor/I2P/Nym transports

**Proposed Architecture:**
```go
type NetworkTransport interface {
    Listen(address string) (net.Listener, error)
    Dial(address string) (net.Conn, error)
    DialPacket(address string) (net.PacketConn, error)
    SupportedNetworks() []string
}

// Network-specific transports
type IPTransport struct{}       // UDP/TCP over IPv4/IPv6
type TorTransport struct{}      // TCP over Tor
type I2PTransport struct{}      // Streaming over I2P
type NymTransport struct{}      // Packets over Nym mixnet

type MultiTransport struct {
    transports map[string]NetworkTransport
}

func (mt *MultiTransport) selectTransport(addr net.Addr) NetworkTransport {
    return mt.transports[addr.Network()]
}
```

#### 4.2 Address Resolution Service

**Bootstrap Process Redesign:**
```go
type AddressResolver interface {
    Resolve(address string) ([]NetworkAddress, error)
    RegisterNetwork(name string, resolver NetworkResolver)
}

type NetworkResolver interface {
    ParseAddress(address string) (NetworkAddress, error)
    ValidateAddress(addr NetworkAddress) error
}

// Example usage
resolver := NewMultiNetworkResolver()
resolver.RegisterNetwork("tor", &TorResolver{})
resolver.RegisterNetwork("i2p", &I2PResolver{})
