## Deliverable 3: Detailed Fix Log

### [CRIT-1]: Missing Noise Handshake Replay Protection

**Original Finding:**
The Noise-IK handshake implementation does not include replay protection mechanisms. An attacker who captures a valid handshake message can replay it to establish unauthorized sessions or cause resource exhaustion.

**Validation:**
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Valid Because**: Security vulnerability enabling session hijacking and DoS attacks

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The handshake processing in `noise/handshake.go` and `transport/noise_transport.go` lacked:
1. Timestamp validation for handshake freshness
2. Nonce tracking to prevent reuse
3. Anti-replay windows
4. Cleanup mechanism for old nonces

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Added `nonce` and `timestamp` fields to IKHandshake struct
2. Implemented `validateHandshakeNonce()` with 5-minute freshness window
3. Added `usedNonces` map with timestamp tracking in NoiseTransport
4. Created `cleanupOldNonces()` background task to prevent memory growth
5. Added `GetNonce()` and `GetTimestamp()` accessor methods

**Code Changes:**
```diff
// noise/handshake.go
type IKHandshake struct {
    role       HandshakeRole
    state      *noise.HandshakeState
    sendCipher *noise.CipherState
    recvCipher *noise.CipherState
    complete   bool
+   timestamp  time.Time
+   nonce      [32]byte
}

// transport/noise_transport.go
type NoiseTransport struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
+   usedNonces  map[[32]byte]int64
+   noncesMu    sync.RWMutex
}

+func (nt *NoiseTransport) validateHandshakeNonce(nonce [32]byte, timestamp time.Time) error {
+   // Check timestamp freshness
+   if time.Since(timestamp) > HandshakeMaxAge {
+       return ErrHandshakeExpired
+   }
+   
+   // Check nonce uniqueness
+   nt.noncesMu.RLock()
+   _, used := nt.usedNonces[nonce]
+   nt.noncesMu.RUnlock()
+   
+   if used {
+       return ErrHandshakeReplay
+   }
+   
+   return nil
+}
```

**Verification:**
- [x] Issue resolved - replay attacks blocked
- [x] No regressions introduced
- [x] Passes go vet
- [x] Passes go test -race
- [x] Manual testing confirms nonce tracking works

---

### [HIGH-1]: NoiseSession Race Condition

**Original Finding:**
The NoiseSession struct is accessed concurrently without proper synchronization, leading to data races that could corrupt cipher states.

**Validation:**
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Valid Because**: Data race vulnerability occurring under normal concurrent operation

**Root Cause Analysis:**
Multiple goroutines accessed NoiseSession fields (complete, sendCipher, recvCipher) simultaneously without synchronization, causing:
1. Cipher state corruption
2. Security bypass (incomplete handshakes appearing complete)
3. Potential panics
4. Information leakage

**Solution Implemented:**
Added per-session mutex with thread-safe accessor methods:

**Code Changes:**
```diff
type NoiseSession struct {
+   mu         sync.RWMutex
    handshake  *toxnoise.IKHandshake
    sendCipher *noise.CipherState
    recvCipher *noise.CipherState
    peerAddr   net.Addr
    role       toxnoise.HandshakeRole
    complete   bool
}

+func (ns *NoiseSession) IsComplete() bool {
+   ns.mu.RLock()
+   defer ns.mu.RUnlock()
+   return ns.complete
+}

+func (ns *NoiseSession) Encrypt(plaintext []byte) ([]byte, error) {
+   ns.mu.Lock()
+   defer ns.mu.Unlock()
+   
+   if !ns.complete {
+       return nil, errors.New("handshake not complete")
+   }
+   return ns.sendCipher.Encrypt(nil, nil, plaintext)
+}
```

**Verification:**
- [x] Issue resolved
- [x] `go test -race` passes with no data races
- [x] Concurrent access tests pass
- [x] No performance regression

### [MED-5]: IPv6 Link-Local Address Handling

**Original Finding:**
IPv6 link-local addresses may be accepted without proper scope validation, potentially allowing local network attacks.

**Validation:**
- **Severity**: MEDIUM (upgraded from LOW for security)
- **Valid Because**: Access control issue allowing potentially unsafe addresses

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The address parsing code detected link-local addresses via `IsPrivate()` but didn't reject them during address conversion, allowing:
1. Local network attacks via fe80::/10 addresses
2. Multicast abuse via ff00::/8 addresses
3. Bypass of network security boundaries

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Added `ValidateAddress()` method to NetworkAddress
2. Implemented `validateIPv6()` with security checks
3. Updated `ConvertNetAddrToNetworkAddress()` to call validation
4. Added comprehensive test coverage

**Code Changes:**
```diff
+func (na *NetworkAddress) ValidateAddress() error {
+   if na == nil {
+       return errors.New("address is nil")
+   }
+   
+   switch na.Type {
+   case AddressTypeIPv6:
+       return na.validateIPv6()
+   default:
+       return nil
+   }
+}

+func (na *NetworkAddress) validateIPv6() error {
+   if len(na.Data) < 16 {
+       return fmt.Errorf("invalid IPv6 address length: %d", len(na.Data))
+   }
+   
+   ip := net.IP(na.Data[:16])
+   
+   if ip.IsLinkLocalUnicast() {
+       return errors.New("link-local IPv6 addresses not allowed for security reasons")
+   }
+   
+   if ip.IsMulticast() {
+       return errors.New("multicast IPv6 addresses not allowed")
+   }
+   
+   return nil
+}

func ConvertNetAddrToNetworkAddress(addr net.Addr) (*NetworkAddress, error) {
    // ... parse address ...
+   
+   // Validate the address for security issues
+   if err := na.ValidateAddress(); err != nil {
+       return nil, fmt.Errorf("address validation failed: %w", err)
+   }
+   
    return na, nil
}
```

**Verification:**
- [x] Issue resolved - link-local addresses rejected
- [x] Test coverage added (TestValidateAddress_IPv6LinkLocal)
- [x] All existing tests pass
- [x] Global IPv6 addresses still work correctly
- [x] IPv4 addresses unaffected
