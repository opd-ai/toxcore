- panic("not implemented") statements
- Empty function bodies with only comments
- Interface methods returning nil/zero values with comments
- Error returns with generic messages like "not yet implemented"
- Commented-out code blocks with "temporary" or "disabled" notes
- Mock implementations and simulation code
