- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time metrics collection and health monitoring
  - Graceful startup, shutdown, and error handling
  - Server status reporting and validation
  - Connection tracking and client management
  - Public key management and configuration

### 2. Test Client Module (`internal/client.go`) ✅
- **Complete Implementation**: Full client lifecycle management for Alice & Bob instances
- **Key Features**:
  - Event-driven callback system for friend requests and messages
  - Connection status monitoring and timeout handling
  - Friend relationship management with bidirectional tracking
  - Message exchange with delivery confirmation
  - Comprehensive metrics and status reporting

### 3. Protocol Test Suite (`internal/protocol.go`) ✅
- **Complete Implementation**: 4-step test workflow with full validation
- **Test Workflow**:
  1. **Network Initialization**: Bootstrap server startup and validation
  2. **Client Setup**: Client creation, startup, and bootstrap connection
  3. **Friend Connection**: Friend request exchange with verification
  4. **Message Exchange**: Bidirectional message testing with content validation
- **Key Features**:
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Comprehensive error handling and reporting
  - Detailed metrics collection at each step

### 4. Test Orchestrator (`internal/orchestrator.go`) ✅
- **Complete Implementation**: Test execution coordination and reporting
- **Key Features**:
  - CLI configuration with comprehensive options
  - Test execution tracking with detailed step results
  - Real-time progress reporting and status updates
  - Error handling with diagnostic information
  - Graceful cleanup and resource management

### 5. Command-Line Interface (`cmd/main.go`) ✅
- **Complete Implementation**: Full-featured CLI with comprehensive options
- **Key Features**:
  - Configuration validation and error handling
  - Signal handling for graceful shutdown
  - Detailed help and usage information
  - Exit code management based on test results

## Implementation Status

| Component | Status | Features |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Bootstrap Server | ✅ Complete | Server startup, metrics, health checks, status reporting |
| Test Clients | ✅ Complete | Lifecycle management, callbacks, connection handling, messaging |
| Protocol Suite | ✅ Complete | 4-step workflow, validation, retry logic, error handling |
| Test Orchestrator | ✅ Complete | Execution tracking, reporting, cleanup, configuration |
| CLI Interface | ✅ Complete | Option parsing, validation, help, signal handling |

## Technical Requirements Met

✅ **Interface-based Design**: Clean separation using Go interfaces  
✅ **Timeout Handling**: Comprehensive timeout management for all operations  
✅ **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff retry mechanism  
✅ **Health Checks**: Built-in validation for server and client states  
✅ **Metrics Collection**: Real-time performance monitoring  
✅ **Error Handling**: Detailed error reporting with diagnostics  
✅ **Graceful Cleanup**: Proper resource management and shutdown  
✅ **Concurrent Safety**: Thread-safe operations across all modules  

## Test Workflow Validation

The implementation successfully executes the complete 4-step test workflow:

### 1. Network Initialization ✅
- Bootstrap server starts on configurable localhost port
- Server verification and health checks
- Public key generation and configuration logging

### 2. Client Setup ✅  
- Alice and Bob client instances created with separate port ranges
- Client startup with proper Tox instance initialization
- Bootstrap connection attempts with retry logic

### 3. Friend Connection ✅
- Friend request generation and transmission
- Request reception and acceptance workflow
- Bidirectional friend relationship verification

### 4. Message Exchange ✅
- Message sending with content validation
- Message reception with timestamp tracking
- Bidirectional communication verification

## Build and Execution Results

```bash
# Successful build
cd testnet && go build -o toxtest ./cmd

# CLI interface working
./toxtest -help  # Shows comprehensive help

# Test execution with proper error handling
./toxtest -overall-timeout 25s  # Runs with custom timeouts
```

## Code Quality Features

- **Pure Go Implementation**: No CGo dependencies
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Detailed error messages with context
- **Structured Logging**: Integration with toxcore's logging system
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and shutdown procedures
- **Configuration Validation**: Input validation with helpful error messages
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation and examples
