# Security Audit Summary - toxcore-go

**Quick Reference Guide**

**Audit Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Full Report:** See [SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md](./SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md)

---

## TL;DR

✅ **APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION** after addressing 3 HIGH priority items (2-3 weeks)

**Overall Security Posture:** MEDIUM-LOW RISK  
**Critical Issues:** 0  
**High Severity:** 3  
**Medium Severity:** 7  

---

## Executive Summary

toxcore-go successfully implements **significant security improvements** over Tox-NACL:

- ✅ **Forward Secrecy:** Pre-key system provides offline message forward secrecy
- ✅ **KCI Resistance:** Noise-IK pattern prevents Key Compromise Impersonation
- ✅ **Metadata Protection:** HKDF-based obfuscation hides peer identities
- ✅ **Formal Verification:** Noise Protocol Framework is formally verified

---

## Priority Actions Required

### HIGH Priority (Fix Before Wide Deployment)

1. **Persistent Replay Protection**
   - Current: In-memory nonce tracking (lost on restart)
   - Fix: Implement persistent nonce storage
   - Timeline: 1-2 weeks
   - Location: `crypto/replay_protection.go` (new file)

2. **Handshake Timeout Management**
   - Current: No timeout for incomplete handshakes
   - Fix: Add 30s timeout + cleanup goroutine
   - Timeline: 1 week
   - Location: `transport/noise_transport.go`

3. **Increase Noise Test Coverage**
   - Current: 39.6% coverage
   - Target: >80% coverage
   - Timeline: 2 weeks
   - Location: `noise/handshake_test.go`

### MEDIUM Priority (Address Within 1 Month)

4. Key storage encryption at rest
5. Session race condition protection
6. Storage monitoring system
7. Cryptographically random session IDs

## Security Comparison: Tox-NACL vs toxcore-go

| Property | Tox-NACL | toxcore-go | Winner |
|----------|----------|------------|--------|
| Forward Secrecy (Offline) | ❌ None | ✅ Pre-keys | **toxcore-go** |
| KCI Resistance | ❌ Vulnerable | ✅ Resistant | **toxcore-go** |
| Metadata Protection | ❌ None | ✅ Strong | **toxcore-go** |
| Formal Verification | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | **toxcore-go** |
| Performance | ✅ Fast | ⚠️ -10-15% | **Tox-NACL** |
| Complexity | ✅ Simple | ⚠️ Higher | **Tox-NACL** |

**Net Result:** toxcore-go is significantly more secure with acceptable trade-offs

## Key Strengths

1. **Cryptographic Implementation**
   - Uses proven libraries (flynn/noise, golang.org/x/crypto)
   - No custom cryptographic primitives
   - Proper constant-time operations
   - Secure memory wiping

2. **Forward Secrecy**
   - Signal-style pre-key system
   - 100 one-time keys per peer
   - Automatic key refresh
   - Keys deleted after use

3. **Privacy Protection**
   - HKDF-based pseudonym obfuscation
   - Sender pseudonyms unique per message
   - Recipient pseudonyms rotate every 6 hours
   - Storage nodes cannot identify real peers

4. **Code Quality**
   - High test coverage (94.4% in crypto)
   - No unsafe package usage
   - Proper error handling
   - Clean architecture

## Remediation Timeline

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 1 | Implement handshake timeouts + DoS protection |
| 2 | Implement persistent replay protection |
| 3-4 | Increase noise package test coverage to >80% |
| 5-6 | Address medium priority items |
| 7 | Final security validation |
| 8 | Production deployment ready |

---

## Production Deployment Checklist

Before wide deployment, ensure:

- [ ] Persistent replay protection implemented and tested
- [ ] Handshake timeout management in place
- [ ] Noise package test coverage >80%
- [ ] DoS resistance tested under load
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan prepared
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented

---

## Compliance Status

✅ **Noise Protocol Framework:** Compliant (with timeout recommendations)  
✅ **Go Memory Safety:** Compliant  
✅ **Cryptographic Best Practices:** Mostly compliant (encryption at rest recommended)  
✅ **Forward Secrecy:** Compliant (with cleanup improvements)  
⚠️ **Critical Vulnerabilities:** None, but 3 HIGH items to address

---

## Conclusion

toxcore-go represents a **major security advancement** over Tox-NACL. The implementation is well-designed, uses proven cryptographic libraries, and provides significant new security capabilities (forward secrecy for offline messages, KCI resistance, metadata protection).

**Recommendation:** Implement 3 HIGH priority fixes (estimated 2-3 weeks), then deploy to production with confidence.
