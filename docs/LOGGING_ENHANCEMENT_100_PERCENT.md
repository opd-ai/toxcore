## Enhanced Logging Patterns Implemented

### 1. **Cryptographic Operation Pattern**
```go
func DeriveSharedSecret(peerPublicKey, privateKey [32]byte) ([32]byte, error) {
    logrus.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
        "function":        "DeriveSharedSecret",
        "peer_key_prefix": fmt.Sprintf("%x", peerPublicKey[:8]),
    }).Info("Computing shared secret using ECDH")
    
    // ... cryptographic operation ...
    
    logrus.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
        "function": "DeriveSharedSecret",
    }).Info("Shared secret computed successfully, sensitive data wiped")
}
```

### 2. **Packet Processing Pattern**
```go
func (p *Packet) Serialize() ([]byte, error) {
    logrus.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
        "function":    "Serialize",
        "packet_type": p.PacketType,
        "data_size":   len(p.Data),
    }).Debug("Serializing packet for transmission")
    
    // ... serialization logic ...
    
    logrus.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
        "function":        "Serialize",
        "serialized_size": len(result),
    }).Debug("Packet serialized successfully")
}
```

### 3. **Resource Management Pattern**
```go
func GetStorageInfo(path string) (*StorageInfo, error) {
    logrus.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
        "function": "GetStorageInfo",
        "path":     path,
    }).Debug("Getting storage information")
    
    // ... filesystem operations ...
    
    logrus.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
        "function":        "GetStorageInfo",
        "total_bytes":     totalBytes,
        "available_bytes": availableBytes,
    }).Info("Storage information retrieved successfully")
}
```
