Craft a detailed and optimized claude-3.7-sonnet-thinking prompt which focuses the LLM on reviewing the toxcore-go code. Use natural language for the prompt. Fence the new optimized prompt in ~~~~. Make it focus on unimplemented methods and structs first, with a minimum viable product being the goal. Don't concern yourself with optimization, if anything, prefer clarity to speed. The prompt should pick one task at a time and provide details about how to accomplish that task. DO NOT include citations. Be short and to the point. Be sure to include file paths and line numbers in your recommendations. Document your recommendations.
