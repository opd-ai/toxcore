Review the toxcore-go codebase for bugs, consistency issues, and implementation gaps. Analyze the code structure focusing on these key areas:

1. Package organization: Examine the DHT, crypto, transport, friend, messaging, and file packages for proper interfaces and dependencies.

2. Core functionality: Identify missing implementations in critical components needed before finalizing the main Tox API.

3. Bug identification: Find potential bugs, race conditions, or security vulnerabilities in existing code. 

4. API consistency: Ensure consistent error handling, naming conventions, and documentation across packages.

5. Protocol compliance: Verify the implementation correctly follows the Tox protocol specifications.

For each issue found:
- Specify the exact file path and line number
- Explain the problem clearly
- Provide a specific code solution or improvement
- Document your reasoning

Focus on completeness of sub-components before considering the core API implementation. Prioritize correctness and clarity over performance optimizations.
